!- I Started the Project on 10 october BUT i added a wrong datatype in the database and the webpage named "ModelYear" where i put datetime datatype however i only need the year.

As i have to make my assignment for monitors i researched and came to the conclusion that i will use these properties for the monitors 
-ID
1.ModelName
2.Manufacturer 
3.ScreenSize 
4.PanelTechnology
5.RefreshRate 
6.Resolution
7.Features 
8.Price
